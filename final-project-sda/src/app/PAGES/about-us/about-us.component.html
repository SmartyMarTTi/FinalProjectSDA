          <p  class='text-center' id="value-info">What is teamwork built on?
            At BWA people work together toward a common goal. Thus, the foundation for teamwork is a common goal. If each team member has a different agenda, collaboration will be difficult, and it will become much harder to produce exceptional work and achieve goals. We always try to ensure our team is set up to work together and collaborate effectively by clearly defining goals on a regular basis.

          <p class='text-center' id='value-info'>At BWA we believe good communication is key. But how do define good communication? Is it 24/7 customer support? Is it communicating with your client(s) through the entire production time? Or is it setting reasonable expectations and goals from the start? At BWA we believe its all of the above. </p>

          <p class='text-center' id='value-info'>Many companies offer a flexible work schedule to help employees better balance their personal and professional lives. Having flexible hours helps improve productivity and has the potential to increase an employee's job satisfaction.
